  <h1>Stop using nix-env.</h1>
  <h3>For the sake of you and others.</h3>
  <p>
    <x-term>nix-env</x-term> was built as a tool for Nix
    as a way to manage packages in a traditional (imperative) fashion.
    It tries to bridge the gap between the imperative and declarative
    world. A replacement for the venerable
    <nobr>"just <x-term>sudo apt install &lt;anything&gt;</x-term>"</nobr>.
    As a result of its design, it often causes unexpected behaviour.
    This page is dedicated to explaining what its issues are and what
    to use instead.
  </p>
  <h2>Installing packages by derivation name</h2>
  <p>
    Packages in Nix are usually bundled in attribute sets. Each
    <i>attribute name</i> represents the name of a package. When installing
    packages declaratively through NixOS or Home Manager, or when declaring
    a package's dependencies, these are uniquely identified using their attribute
    name. When installing packages via <x-term>nix-env -i</x-term>,
    attribute names are ignored. Instead, <x-term>nix-env</x-term> traverses
    the entire attribute set to find a package with a matching
    <i>derivation name</i>. This can lead to fun surprises when
    the derivation name does not match the attribute name, such as
    installing an unwrapped package that requires a wrapper to function
    properly. This can be avoided by using <x-term>nix-env -iA</x-term>
    instead, which picks packages via attribute name, but does not
    note down from which attribute path a package originally came from,
    resulting in surprises when upgrading it.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <x-termblock>
{
  pkg = < derivation pkg-wrapper-1.3 >;

  pkg-unwrapped = < derivation pkg-1.3 >;
}
    </x-termblock>
  </pre>
  <h2>Name collisions when upgrading packages</h2>
  <p>
    <x-term>nix-env -u</x-term> will upgrade all packages in your profile
    by searching through the attribute set for a derivation with the same
    derivation name and a higher version number. When using large,
    nested package collections like nixpkgs, derivations from different
    language ecosystems may be stored under a distinct attribute path,
    but their derivation name may be the same, despite the two packages
    being clearly different otherwise.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <x-termblock>
{
  zstd = < derivation zstd-2.0 >;

  haskellPackages = {

    zstd = < derivation zstd-3.0 >;

  };
}
    </x-termblock>
  </pre>
  <h2>Unintentional major version jumps</h2>
  <p>
    Nixpkgs sometimes keeps multiple major versions for packages that have
    multiple continuously maintained release trains, such as PostgreSQL.
    Because the distinction between major versions is done via attribute
    names, <x-term>nix-env</x-term> completely ignores it. When installing
    <x-term>postgresql_12</x-term> via its attribute name, you would
    expect PostgreSQL to stay at major version 12, even when upgraded.
    Even though <x-term>postgresql_12</x-term> and
    <x-term>postgresql_14</x-term> may exist in parallel within the same
    nixpkgs revision, <x-term>nix-env</x-term> ignores this fact and will
    happily upgrade your PostgreSQL package to major version 14.
  </p>
  <h2>Performance issues</h2>
  <p>
    As you may have already guessed, iterating over a large package set and
    evaluating every derivation in it is
    <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/38635">not very efficient</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Non-obvious shadowing</h2>
  <p>
    <x-term>nix-env</x-term> installs packages into a user-specific
    profile that has precedence over system-level directories in
    <x-term>$PATH</x-term>. This means that you can install a
    different version of any tool in your user profile without the rest of
    the system having to use that version. If you forget that you installed
    a program into your user profile like this, you may end up with a nasty
    surprise later down the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, installing <x-term>busybox</x-term> this way would shadow
    common utilities such as <x-term>ls</x-term>, <x-term>cat</x-term> or
    <x-term>grep</x-term>. The next time you would try to use a GNU-specific
    feature of <x-term>grep</x-term> months down the line, you might end up
    going on a wild goose chase to figure out why your version of
    <x-term>grep</x-term> behaves differently than everyone else's.
  </p>
  <h2>Implicit package pinning</h2>
  <p>
    Packages installed by <x-term>nix-env</x-term> are independent of the NixOS
    or Home Manager configuration. This can be beneficial because NixOS
    upgrades will never change what versions of packages a user has installed,
    however it is a common source of confusion, as a system update
    ("<x-term>apt upgrade</x-term>") on regular distros will truly upgrade
    all packages, while on NixOS or when using Home Manager, this is not the
    case.
  </p>
  <h2>Informational Video by Matthew Croughan</h2>
  <p>Matthew Croughan demonstrates some of the issues with <x-term>nix-env</x-term>.

  </p>
  <h2>Alternatives</h2>
  <p>
    So, <x-term>nix-env</x-term> is bad. What do we use instead? First,
    it's important to consider that Nix is a far more powerful package
    manager than your garden variety ones like APT or DNF. As such, there
    is more than one way to <i>provide</i> a package. Merely installing
    the package is probably never your end goal. Consider what you want
    to do with this package, and then choose how to expose the package
    in the target environment appropriately.
  </p>
  <h2>Declarative package management</h2>
  <p>
    This is the best choice for any packages you expect to be
    <i>long-living</i>. Any applications that you commonly use should be
    managed in this way. Packages can be managed declaratively through
    tools such as NixOS configuration or Home Manager. These will often
    also provide a set of options to configure the application in Nix code.
    System services should only be configured through these options,
    which will automatically define a suitable systemd service according
    to your specifications.
  </p>
  <h2>Ephemeral shell environments</h2>
  <p>
    Do you often run into a situation where you need a particular command
    for a one-off thing, but don't feel like it should reside on your system
    at all times?
    <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/ad-hoc-shell-environments.html">Ephemeral shells</a>
    allow you to <i>gain temporary access</i> to a command and after you exit
    out of the shell, it's as if the package was never installed.
    If you're using Flakes,
    <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-shell.html"><x-term>nix shell</x-term></a>
    may be more up your alley.
  </p>
  <h2><x-term>nix profile</x-term></h2>
  <p>
    Lastly,
    <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-profile.html"><x-term>nix profile</x-term></a>
    from the Nix 3.0 (Flakes) set of CLI commands aims to provide a more
    polished imperative package management solution. If you really need to
    imperatively manage some of your packages, this is your best option.
    It picks packages by attribute name rather than derivation name and it
    keeps track of the attribute path from which each package was installed,
    meaning name collisions when upgrading are eliminated. Thanks to Flakes,
    it also allows you to easily install packages from package collections
    other than nixpkgs.
