C S U A   # 1 1 :
3/20    If you're going to troll the motd today, please make
        that extra effort and at least try to use proper
        grammar.  I know you like to pretend that you are
        an angry immigrant troll who just moved to Berkeley
        but I know you had to take the TOEFL before being
        admitted so I know you're not a moron.  Thank you.
